Current state of nbn grid squares download:
- comes down as zip file with 3 files (csv squares, metadata, readme) - not json :(
- must have a 'band' parameter that ends in a comma! - eg 'band=1990-2000,' (not documented)
- must have a resolution parameter (not documented)
- squares are BNG or ING grid refs, so no lat/lon :(

Example call, Azure hawker:
https://data.nbn.org.uk/api/gridMapSquares/NBNSYS0000005623?band=1900-2000,&resolution=1km

Documentation says that this end point should give json for a name, but always just returns []:
